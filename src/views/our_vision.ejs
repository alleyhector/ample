      <h4>Our Beginnings</h4>

      We started building Ample in 2017 because we believed in a future
      where all bodies feel welcomed and safe, and
      we think technology can help.

      <br />
      <br />

      Co-founders Alissa and Gus, lifelong best friends, teamed up to make an app that
      they both needed. As a fat person and a trans person, both wanted a way to find
      doctors that have an inclusive attitude towards their non-conforming bodies.
      They aren’t alone in that desire; when people believe they will be stigmatized
      by their doctors, they avoid seeking health care, which can lead to
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4381543/">late or missed medical diagnoses.</a>
      Then they started thinking bigger— What about
      finding a movie theater with larger-sized seating, or a store that sells clothes
      with trans bodies in mind? What about those in disabled bodies who need information
      about access to a building? What about bodies at the intersections of fat, trans, and
      disabled? Having this information could be the difference between going and not going.

      <br />
      <br />
      <h4>Our Vision</h4>

      Ample is similar in function to other popular review sites, however, it’s the first app
      that rates businesses specifically on their accessibility and inclusiveness towards
      marginalized bodies. You can search for businesses to discover what others are saying
      and then rate and review establishments, both positively and negatively, on the job
      they’re doing. Reviews can be filtered based on the perspective you’re interested in,
      or we’ll show you the businesses that are shining in all categories. We use both a star
      rating and a tags system within our reviews to display targeted, detailed information
      about each establishment so that you know what to expect before going. The body-positive
      community is growing every day, and here at Ample, we think think we can help.

      <br />
      <br />

      <h4>The Future</h4>

      We launched our app in April, 2018. Since then, we have been hard at work to respond to
      community feedback, expand our reach, and develop new features. The Ample Team is growing
      to include diverse talents and perspectives. <a href="/feedback">Let us know</a> what features are important to
      you! Make sure to keep an eye on our <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.isitample.com">blog</a> for new feature
      rollout, transparency about what's going on at Ample, and conversations about accessibility.

      <br />
      <br />

      <h4>Open Source</h4>

      Ample is an open source project. We’ve been developing
      this app in the open from day one because we think the best
      way to build an inclusive and socially-just community
      is to encourage collaboration and transparency. If
      you’d like to watch our progress or get involved,
