Ample is the internet's first body liberation app. Reviews of doctors and businesses are collected; these establishments are rated on their fat-friendliness... does the doctor understand Health At Every Size, or will they require you to start a diet before they treat your ailment? Does the movie theater have too small of seats for large-bodied people to comfortably sit? Does that masseuse focus on the respect and comfort of bodies of all sizes? Find out on Ample, where friends help friends avoid fatphobia and sizeism.
