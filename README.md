Ample is the internet's first body liberation app. Reviews of doctors, businesses, and services are collected; these establishments are rated on their inclusivity and accessibility... does the doctor understand Health At Every Size, or will they require you to start a diet before they treat your ailment? Does that massage therapist ask gender pronouns? Does the movie theater have too small of seats for large-bodied people to comfortably sit? Is there dedicated handicap parking? Find out on Ample.
