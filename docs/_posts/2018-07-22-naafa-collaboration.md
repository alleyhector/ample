Founded in 1969, the National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance (NAAFA) is a non-profit, all volunteer, civil rights organization dedicated to protecting the rights and improving the quality of life for fat people. NAAFA works to eliminate discrimination based on body size and provide fat people with the tools for self-empowerment through advocacy, public education, and support.

NAAFA spearheaded the Size Savvy project four years ago. The goal of the Size Savvy project was to provide reviews of businesses and healthcare providers where one would be made to feel welcome and accommodated regardless of body size.  

The Ample team has been working with NAAFA over the past several weeks to import Size Savvy reviews from the greater Las Vegas area into Ample’s platform. We are grateful for the sharing of this information, and appreciate the work done by the Size Savvy reviewers.

NAAFA envisions a society in which people of every size are accepted with dignity and equality in all aspects of life. Ample co-signs this vision!
