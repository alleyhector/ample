We’re excited! We’ve reworked our search algorithms on Ample so that users can manually input the small portion of providers and businesses that do not come up in search.

![Image Description: A screenshot of the new ‘Add a Business’ interface, which appears as a web form where the Ample user can input the name and contact information of a business. At the bottom, there are drop menus to categorize the type of business. Overlain on the screenshot is a cartoon graphic of a fat, blonde, feminine-presenting person with the Ample peach logo is on her shirt. She is smiling and leaning into the frame to gesture to the new ‘Add a Business’ interface. Blue stars surround her, to convey the celebration of something new.]({{ "/assets/img/add-business-1.png" | absolute_url }})

Here’s how it works: Go ahead and search for the business you’re looking for! If none of the search results are the one you’re looking for, you’ll see an option to ‘Add the business here’ at the bottom of the results page.

![Image description: A screenshot of an example search result page. Underneath the search results is a section that reads, “Missing the business you were looking for? Add the business here.” Overlain on the screenshot is a cartoon graphic of a very fat, masculine PoC, who is smiling and gesturing to the ‘Add the business here’ hyperlink. Blue stars surround the section, to convey the celebration of something new.]({{ "/assets/img/add-business-2.png" | absolute_url }})

Similarly, if Ample doesn’t return any results for your search term and location, you will be presented with the option to add the business.

![Image description: A screenshot of an example search result page where no results were returned. In that space, a banner message reads, “Oops! We couldn’t find any businesses for that search term and location. You can add the business here, or try a new search.” Overlain on the screenshot is a cartoon graphic of a short, transmasculine person with the Trans Pride flag on their shirt. They are smiling and gesturing to the ‘add the business here’ hyperlink. Blue stars surround the section, to convey the celebration of something new.]({{ "/assets/img/add-business-3.png" | absolute_url }})

Please note that by adding a business entry to Ample, you are **not** registering your business with Google Places. These business entries will be in our database, and not cross posted to other platforms.

There are other, more subtle changes that have been made on Ample in addition to ‘Add a Business.’ You may have noticed we’ve changed the language of the ratings categories. This was in part to communicate a lack of hierarchy between the ratings categories, but also because language like “Awareness” can be a bit vague. It is possible to be aware and still be discriminatory, for example. We went with “Inclusivity” because it better encapsulated what these ratings are communicating— the amount to which we are included, or not.

We also added a few hyperlinks around the site and blog to make navigation easier and more intuitive. Lastly, we’ve also added ‘Academic Institutions’ and ‘Religious Organizations’ to our business categories, which can be found in the drop menu at the bottom of the review form.

We hope you enjoy these new changes! As always, we welcome your [feedback](http://isitample.com/feedback "Ample's feedback page") and invite your collaboration. There are more in the works, we promise. Ample only gets more awesome from here!
