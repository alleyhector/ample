Each listing on Ample now has a link for the business owner or service provider to claim their page on the Ample platform. To claim, click the blue claim button near the business title. You will then be prompted to fill out a small online form so Ample can verify the legitimacy of the claim. There are perks to claiming your business.

Optionally, but importantly, business owners can take a pledge to treat people of all genders, body sizes, races, and abilities equally. By taking the pledge, businesses and providers will appear on our world map of inclusive providers. They will also appear near the top of returned search results, regardless of whether they have been reviewed. This is a great way to promote your business or service to those searching for inclusive and friendly establishments. A badge will appear on the business’ page indicating that the the owner has taken the pledge.

Another perk of taking the pledge is the opportunity to upload a statement of business philosophy. This may also include mention of specific efforts towards making the space or service accessible to all. This statement will be displayed on the listing for the business along with the pledge badge.

At Ample, we want to make every effort to connect you —the user— with resources that will be useful to you. By giving business owners the tools to ‘put themselves on the map,’ we hope to increase the pool of options available to you, and to better highlight those business owners who are conscious and deliberate about their inclusivity efforts.
